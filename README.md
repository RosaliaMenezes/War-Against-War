# War Against War
This organization is one that has fought against the government, peacefully, against the use
of war as a way to make change occur in the world.Our goal is to capture the struggles that 
an organization that seeks to put an end to wars would face, such as needing to use violence
in certain circumstances as well as the political turmoil that we may facde within our own 
organization.
